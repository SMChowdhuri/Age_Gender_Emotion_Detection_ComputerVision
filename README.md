**Age, Gender, and Emotion Detection | Computer Vision**

**Overview**
This project is a real-time system that detects age, gender, and emotions from live video feeds using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MTCNN for face detection. The models are trained using the UTKFace and CKPlus datasets and deployed on the web using Django.

Features
